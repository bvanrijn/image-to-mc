`image-to-minecraft` lets you recreate any image inside Minecraft, completely automatically.
It is **very much** a work in progress and an alpha. It will be versioned once all features are implemented in a stable way.

## Requirements

Download the required images from [http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/](http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/) and place them in `items/images`.

You will also need to do `sudo apt install libxtst-dev`.
